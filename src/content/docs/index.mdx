The MacroLibX is a fast, easy to use, cross-platform graphics library to create applications without having to work directly with low level graphics APIs.
It provides a simple window management and primitive tools for drawing onto the window such as displaying images from disk or drawing pixels directly.

	<Card title="Lightning fast" icon="rocket">
		Built on top of Vulkan, the MacroLibX takes advantage of its very low-level nature to achieve high performance with great control over available resources.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Close to the old minilibx" icon="approve-check-circle">
		One of the guidelines of this lib was to get as close as possible to the old minilibx API, and therefore to the educational choices of the old minilibx.
	</Card>
	<Card title="It's all FOSS" icon="open-book">
		Everything in the MacroLibX is entirely free and open source, all available under the MIT license (even the& third-party libraries used).
	</Card>
	<Card title="Cross-platform" icon="laptop">
		Designed to be totally cross-platform, it can run on any SDL2-supported platform that supports Vulkan (even the Nintendo Switch ! theoretically... ).
